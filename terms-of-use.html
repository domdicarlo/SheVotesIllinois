Upon receipt of a DMCA compliant notice, we will expeditiously remove or disable access to the content that is the subject of the notice.</p>
            <p>The She Votes Illinois Site contains information from third-party sources.

            <br><br>
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>These terms of use include our <a href="privacy-policy.html">privacy policy</a> which describes how we use your personal information.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Other Websites</h2>
            <p>We may provide links to other websites, but we cannot control what those sites say or do. In particular, websites to which we link may request your personal and/or financial information. She Votes Illinois is not responsible for other sites’ content, information collection practices, or use of the information they collect. She Votes Illinois’s links to other websites do not constitute an endorsement of those sites or their content, owners, or posters.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Campaign Finance Laws</h2>
            <p>Political contributions are governed by campaign finance laws. She Votes Illinois makes its best efforts to ensure that all contributions made on the She Votes Illinois site are in accordance with these laws. Nonetheless, you have final responsibility for ensuring your own compliance. You (and not She Votes Illinois) are responsible for ensuring that your total contributions through different avenues do not exceed your contribution limits.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Other Laws</h2>
            <p>Donations from charities (501(c)(3) organizations) and social welfare groups (501(c)(4) organizations) are not subject to any contributions limits. She Votes Illinois will disclose when requests for donations are in relation to partisan events or purposes. All donations will be reported to the Illinois State Board of Elections. Donations to She Votes Illinois are not tax deductible as charitable contributions. She Votes Illinois cannot be responsible for your treatment of these donations on your tax returns. It is your responsibility to report your donations accurately as required and to pay your taxes. We recommend consulting your tax adviser or tax preparer if you have any questions.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Refund policy</h2>
            <p>She Votes Illinois will attempt to accommodate requests for refunds of donations made in error. We do our best to honor refunds requested for reasons such as input error, when a contributor accidentally donates twice or enters the wrong donation amount. She Votes Illinois will not consider refunds for other reasons such as a change in political or personal opinion or the cancellation of an event. She Votes Illinois reserves the right to refuse a refund request for these or other reasons.</p>
            <p>All refund requests are subject to the availability of the contribution funds. Because She Votes Illinois uses these contributions to make payments for goods or services, She Votes Illinois will only refund a contribution if we still have the funds. For this reason, it is of the utmost importance that you <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contact">make your request</a> for a refund as soon after making a contribution in error as possible and contact us <a href="lets-connect.php">here</a>.</p>
            <p>All refunds issued by She Votes Illinois will be credited back to the card used to make the contribution if processed by ActBlue. Otherwise, She Votes Illinois will issue a check back to the donor.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Amendments</h2>
            <p>She Votes Illinois may change its Terms of Use Policy from time to time, and at She Votes Illinois’ sole discretion. She Votes Illinois will post a notice of change on our website if and when amendments are made to our policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Terms of Use Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the state of Illinois and the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Cook County, State of Illinois.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>You may contact us directly <a href="lets-connect.php">here</a> should you have any questions regarding this policy.</p>
