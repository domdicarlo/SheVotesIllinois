                          While most cases of COVID-19 cause a mild illness, the virus is spreading easily from person to person and this puts entire communities at risk. And as the virus continues to spread, the high mortality rate for black residents is alarming while the Latino community is underreported and ignored. For people over 60 years of age, the risk of contracting COVID-19 increases significantly and escalates with age, with persons over age 80 in the highest risk category.
                          <br><br>
                          Everyone has a role to play in this. That’s why we’re partnering with community organizers to check in on residents in some of the hardest hit areas of Cook County during the coronavirus pandemic.
                          <br><br>

                        <p style="padding:1.5rem;">
                          As more Illinoisans face job loss as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, inability to pay for water is becoming more common. Homes that had previously lost service due to nonpayment have not had their water reconnected, making it impossible to follow the most basic and consistent advice of the CDC: wash your hands.
                          <br><br>
                          While Governor Pritzker has issued a moratorium on shut-offs for investor-owned companies, many are still vulnerable to municipal water shut-offs. Now is the time for the Governor to comprehensively assure Illinois that water will be supplied during this unprecedented crisis.
                          <br><br>
                          The pandemic is disproportionately affecting low-income communities. Those who have lost income due to the pandemic are being deprived of a basic and necessary human right. The Governor is responsible for the public safety of everyone in Illinois, especially those most vulnerable during this crisis. The very thing that can help protect Illinoisans from the virus should not be withheld.

                          Join She Votes Illinois and over 40 other organizations led by <a href="https://www.foodandwateraction.org/">Food & Water Action</a> in urging <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/gov/contactus/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pritzker</a> to follow the lead of Michigan and Ohio in mandating water reconnection, specifically asking him to:

                            <li>
                              Order a statewide moratorium on water shutoffs for nonpayment for all public and private systems;

                            <li>
                              Require immediate restoration of water service to all homes previously disconnected for nonpayment; and
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Waive all late fees, penalties, service restoration fees, and water rate increases during the state of emergency.

                          She Votes Illinois has partnered with the <a href="https://unachicago.org/">United Nations Association of Chicago</a> along with other local organizations with an objective to have the City of Chicago pass a resolution to ratify and implement CEDAW, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women.
                          <br><br>
                          CEDAW is the international bill of rights for women and is a comprehensive treaty that addresses issues like education inequality, employment discrimination, healthcare choices, political participation, equal rights, gender discrimination, economic and social protections, equal access to opportunities, rights in marriage and home life, and human trafficking.
