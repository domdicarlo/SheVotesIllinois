                      <p>
                        We express our beliefs in many ways, but one of the most 
                        effective is voting. Voting for officials that hold your same 
                        values can change the trajectory of our education, our neighborhoods, 
                        our finances and our lives and futures.
                        <br><br>
                        Whether it’s at the municipal, state or federal level, your voice matters. 
                        Elections matter. Your voice is heard by your vote. A single vote can decide an election.
                        Use your voice through your vote to send a powerful message about what you care 
                        about and who you want representing your interests. She Votes Illinois is 
                        here to make sure that you have all the tools you need to vote!

                          In efforts to allow for a safer election during the COVID-19 pandemic, Illinois legislators passed <a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10100SB1863ham005&GA=101&SessionId=109&DocTypeId=SB&LegID=119533&DocNum=1863&GAID=15&Session=0">SB1863</a> during the Special Session in May to automatically send an application for a vote-by-mail ballot to any resident who has voted in the 2018 general election, the 2019 consolidated election or the 2020 primary election as well as anyone who registered to vote after the 2020 primary by July 31, 2020. Previous mail-in voters who do not respond to initial invitations to sign up again would be sent reminders in September and October. Completed ballots would be returned via mail or in new “collection sites,” that would consist of boxes placed in locations at the discretion of local election officials.
                          <br><br>
                          As for voting in person, the bill would allow local election authorities to implement curbside voting, in which voters can drive up, be handed a ballot and fill it out in their cars. The bill also declares Election Day, November 3, 2020, a state holiday.

                    <h2>A social media series spotlighting Illinois women running for office in the upcoming election</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>From COVID19 to racial justice to women's equity, we asked all female candidates across the state who are running for office in the Illinois General Assembly and US Congress to answer questions around issues that are important to women. The candidates who participated also shared with us: </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Who they are</b></li>
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Stories about the women in their life</b></li>
                      <br>
                      <li><b>And why YOU should vote for them!</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Currently, there are only 36% women representing us in the Illinois General Assembly and 23% of the U.S. House of Representatives. Through our social media series, we want to help get OUR voices represented -- after all, 51% of Illinois residents are women. Bringing in better gender diversity to our local government will create more collaborative efforts and help prioritize what’s truly important to the well-being of the citizens of Illinois. <b>Click on the candidates’ pictures below to learn more about who they are and their message for a better Illinois (link leads to candidate's website).</b> </p>
